# features

_propdoc_ proposes a new way of documenting Vue components, by including some (or all) of the documentation in the component itself.

**Benefits:**
- _props_ can be directly annotated, making documentation essentially the same as commenting a prop
- Documentation can live directly in the component - thus centralizing the documentation and hopefully helping the development/documentation cycle

**Downsides:**
- If all documentation is built into the options object, the component will use additional space
  - This can be mitigated by externalizing the larger proposed keys such as `description` and `token`

## new keys

### full example

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'checkbox'
  introduction: 'an amazing checkbox',
  description: `
  This \`checkbox\` is amazing, you should _check_ it out.
  `,
  token: "<checkbox label="foo"></checkbox>",
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      default: '',
      note: "a label to be appended after the checkbox"
    }
  }
}
```

#### note

_note_ is used alongside expanded (object-style) props to describe that prop in more detail

#### introduction

a brief summary of what the component is or does

#### description

a more in-depth documentation of the component, will be parsed using Markdown. Note that code will need to be escaped if it's inside of a Javascript string literal.

#### token

a quick example of the component's actual use, great for providing a way to quickly copy/paste in the future


# use

`import propDoc from 'propdoc'`

## example

```Vue
<script>
import propDoc from 'propdoc'
import myComponent from './myComponent.vue'

export default {
  components: { propDoc },
  data() {
    return { documentMe: myComponent }
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <prop-doc :component="documentMe"></prop-doc>
  </div>
</template>
```

### props

- `component`: **required** and should be the component object itself
- `documentation`: optional, can be any subset of `component`, and will take precedence; useful for two functions
  - if the component's name or other fields should be output differently for documentation
  - for the optional documentation fields, as these will cause some additional space to be used by your components if not separated
